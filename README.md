# Hate-Speech-Detection
This project is a hate speech detector that uses Logistic Regression as its machine learning algorithm. The front-end of the application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How it Works

The hate speech detector is based on Logistic Regression, which is a machine learning algorithm used for binary classification. The algorithm is trained on a dataset of text labeled as hate speech or not hate speech, and uses this training data to predict whether a given text is hate speech or not. A brief look of the finished project is provided in the 'screenshots.pdf' file.
